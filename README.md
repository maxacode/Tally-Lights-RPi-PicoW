Last notes: 
- brightenss endpoint on recievers to chagne the brightness of the LED red, green, blue
- red/green WS2812B LED on the Base to show when preview/program is on
  - Possible but might take to much cpu time to update the LED with just PICO
- When tally goes offline, the others should still be able to be used, right now they wait for try to finish
